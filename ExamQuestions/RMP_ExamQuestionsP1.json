  "explanation_en": "Correct answer: C. Transfer.\n\nRisk transfer is a risk response strategy in which the project team shifts the ownership and impact of a threat to a third party that is better able to manage it (for example, through insurance, outsourcing, or contracting specialists). In this scenario, involving a third party with more experience clearly indicates risk transfer.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Avoid: Eliminates the risk entirely, which is not the case here.\n- Exploit: Applies to opportunities, not threats.\n- Reduce: Lowers probability or impact but keeps ownership within the project team.",

    "Organization management reserve",
    "Unplanned risk reserve",
    "Contingency reserve",
    "Management reserve"

  "explanation_en": "Correct answer: C (Contingency reserve).\n\nA contingency reserve is allocated for **identified (known) risks** that have been analyzed and documented in the risk register. When a risk that was previously identified is triggered, the appropriate source of funding to implement the planned risk response is the **contingency reserve**.\n\nManagement reserves are intended for **unknown-unknown risks** that were not identified during planning. Even though the remaining funds are labeled as management reserve, a triggered risk from the risk register must be handled using contingency reserves, not management reserves.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\n- A (Organization management reserve): This is not a formally recognized PMI funding category for project-level risk response.\n- B (Unplanned risk reserve): This term is not defined in PMBOK and is therefore invalid.\n- D (Management reserve): Used only for unforeseen risks and requires sponsor approval; it is not intended for known risks.",
  "explanation_vi": "Đáp án đúng: **C. Contingency reserve**.\n\n📌 Giải thích:\nTheo PMI, **contingency reserve** được lập ra để xử lý **các rủi ro đã được nhận diện (known risks)** và ghi trong **risk register**.\n\nTrong câu hỏi:\n- Rủi ro **đã nằm trong risk register**,\n- Rủi ro **đã kích hoạt (triggered)**,\n- Có kế hoạch ứng phó → **phải dùng contingency reserve**.\n\n💡 Management reserve chỉ dùng cho **unknown-unknown risks** (rủi ro chưa từng nhận diện), không dùng cho rủi ro đã biết.\n\n❌ Vì sao các đáp án khác sai:\n- **A**: Không phải thuật ngữ chuẩn PMI cho quỹ dự phòng dự án.\n- **B**: “Unplanned risk reserve” không tồn tại trong PMBOK.\n- **D**: Management reserve cần sponsor approval và **không dùng cho rủi ro đã xác định**.\n\n🧠 Mẹo thi RMP:\n👉 **Risk đã có trong risk register + bị trigger** → luôn chọn **Contingency Reserve**.\n👉 **Risk chưa từng biết** → mới nghĩ tới **Management Reserve**.",
